## Dependencies

All the python library dependencies will be installed automatically.
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is an optional dependency. It is used
for searching if it is available in PATH, otherwise python library thefuzz is
used. fzf is faster and more effective, so it is recommended to install it.

### Disclaimer

I made this project as a demo for practice, it is not intended for practical use.
