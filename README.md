## Dependencies

All the python library dependencies will be installed automatically.
![FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is an optional dependency. It is used
for searching if it is available in PATH, otherwise python library `thefuzz` is
used. `fzf` is faster and more effective, so it is recommended to install it.

### Disclaimer

I made this project as a demo for practice, it is not intended for practical use.
